**Next-Generation Decentralized GPU Rental Protocol on Base**

RENDERBASE is an advanced decentralized protocol that combines AI optimization, edge computing, and DePIN infrastructure to provide the most efficient GPU rental marketplace. Built on Base blockchain for trustless, intelligent, and geographically-optimized compute allocation.

## üîß How It Works

- **GPU Providers** connect their hardware globally and earn rewards through our intelligent staking system
- **GPU Renters** access AI-optimized GPU allocation with real-time latency optimization
- **Smart Routing** automatically selects optimal GPUs based on workload requirements and geographic proximity
- All interactions managed **on-chain** through audited smart contracts with advanced DePIN features

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For GPU Renters
```bash
npm install @renderbase/sdk
javascriptimport { RenderBaseClient } from '@renderbase/sdk';

const client = new RenderBaseClient({
  network: 'base-mainnet',
  privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
  optimizeWorkload: true, // Enable AI optimization
  preferEdgeNodes: true   // Use edge computing
});

// AI-optimized GPU rental
const rental = await client.rentOptimalGPU({
  workload: 'stable-diffusion',
  priority: 'latency', // or 'cost' or 'performance'
  maxLatency: 50, // ms
  duration: '1h'
});

console.log(`Optimal GPU allocated: ${rental.gpuType} at ${rental.location}`);
console.log(`Estimated latency: ${rental.estimatedLatency}ms`);
For GPU Providers
bashgit clone https://github.com/renderbase/gpu-node
cd gpu-node
docker-compose up -d

# Enable geographic staking for bonus rewards
./configure-geo-staking --region=us-west --stake-amount=1000
