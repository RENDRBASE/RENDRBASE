**Next-Generation Decentralized GPU Rental Protocol on Base (Coming Soon)**

rendrbase is an advanced decentralized protocol in development that will combine AI optimization, edge computing, and DePIN infrastructure to provide the most efficient GPU rental marketplace. Built on Base blockchain for trustless, intelligent, and geographically-optimized compute allocation.

## 🌟 Project Overview

rendrbase aims to democratize access to high-performance GPU computing through a decentralized, AI-optimized network. Our platform will enable anyone to rent powerful GPUs on-demand while providing sustainable income opportunities for hardware providers worldwide.

### Key Innovations
- **$RENDR Token Ecosystem**: All platform interactions powered by our native token
- **AI Workload Optimization**: Machine learning algorithms for optimal GPU matching
- **Geographic Staking**: Incentivized global coverage with regional rewards
- **Edge Computing Network**: Ultra-low latency processing with distributed nodes
- **Real-time Latency Oracles**: On-chain performance monitoring and routing

## 🔧 How It Will Work (At Launch)

- **GPU Providers** will connect their hardware globally and earn rewards through our intelligent staking system
- **GPU Renters** will access AI-optimized GPU allocation with real-time latency optimization
- **Smart Routing** will automatically select optimal GPUs based on workload requirements and geographic proximity
- All interactions will be managed **on-chain** through audited smart contracts with advanced DePIN features

## 🚀 Technology Stack
